I had the exciting opportunity to participate in a **#datacleaningchallenge** organized by ***Promise Chinonso*** and fellow data enthusiasts within the data-tech community. This challenge aimed to create an environment where data analysts at all levels, from novice to advanced, could enhance their data cleaning skills. The competition not only provided a platform for connecting with other participants and expanding networks but also encouraged showcasing data cleaning prowess using various tools like *Excel, Power-Query, SQL, Python, R, and Google Sheets*.

Data cleaning, also known as data wrangling, is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves preparing and validating the data to ensure its accuracy, consistency, and relevance. The main focus is on identifying and correcting inaccuracies, incompleteness, corruption, and formatting errors in the data.

For this project, the dataset was shared with all the participants. I imported it into MSSQL before linking it to POSTGRESQL for the cleaning process. It contained information about football players and their performances up until 2021, with 18,979 rows and 79 columns.

With relentless passion, I embarked on the captivating exploration and cleaning phase. Amidst the chaos and disarray, I summoned my expertise, meticulously refining the data until it gleamed with perfection – ready to reveal its hidden stories.

But the magic didn't stop there. Armed with the indomitable PostgreSQL, I conquered every challenge that stood in my way. The links below hold the key to this triumph:
